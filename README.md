# 🧠 Brain Tumor Class Imbalance Solution using GANs

## Project Overview
This project addresses the critical issue of **Class Imbalance** in medical imaging datasets, specifically in Brain Tumor MRI scans. Imbalanced datasets lead to biased machine learning models that fail to detect minority classes (e.g., healthy brains or rare tumor types).

To solve this, we implemented and compared three Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architectures to generate synthetic images for the minority class:
1.  **Vanilla GAN**
2.  **Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)**
3.  **Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)**

## Dataset
* **Source:** [Brain Tumor MRI Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/)
* **Classes:** Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, No Tumor.
* **Imbalance:** The class **'No Tumor'** was identified as the minority class.

## Methodology
1.  **Data Analysis:** visualized the class distribution to confirm imbalance.
2.  **GAN Training:** Trained Vanilla, DCGAN, and WGAN models exclusively on the minority class (`no_tumor`) for 200 epochs.
3.  **Augmentation:** Generated synthetic images to balance the dataset.
4.  **Evaluation:** Trained a CNN classifier on:
    * Original Imbalanced Data
    * Data balanced with Vanilla GAN
    * Data balanced with DCGAN
    * Data balanced with WGAN

## Results
Our experiments showed that **WGAN** provided the most significant improvement in detecting the minority class (Recall), while **Vanilla GAN** achieved the best overall accuracy.

| Scenario | Total Accuracy | Recall (no_tumor) | F1-Score |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Original (Imbalanced)** | 0.84 | 0.79 | 0.84 |
| **Vanilla GAN** | **0.87** | 0.89 | 0.90 |
| **DCGAN** | 0.85 | 0.89 | 0.92 |
| **WGAN** | 0.86 | **0.94** | **0.94** |

## Key Takeaways
* **WGAN** proved to be the most effective for medical diagnosis purposes, achieving a **94% Recall**, drastically reducing false negatives.
* **DCGAN** produced the most visually coherent and realistic images.
* GAN-based augmentation successfully mitigated model bias compared to the baseline.
